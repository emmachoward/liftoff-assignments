## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The Neopian Times is an online newspaper that has been in publication for over twenty years. Recently there’s been discussion among its contributors about creating an archive of its history, including early hard-to-access content. More than just a clone, though, this archive would have improved functionality and features such as a responsive mobile-friendly design and improved search function.
### Features
Navigation: Users will be able to navigate to content using pages and a menu.
Responsive Design: Users will be able to enjoy the website on both mobile and desktop.
Search Function: Users will be able to search content and authors.
### Technologies
JavaScript
React
Bootstrap
Google Fonts
Font Awesome
### What I'll Have to Learn
I need a complex search function, but I’ve only ever built a simple one. I’ll need to do some research into building a proper search function or find a technology that pairs with React to use as a search function.
